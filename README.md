<h1>Simple To-Do List</h1>
This is the first complete app I did by myself and amazingly it works! :grinning: <br><br>
It is very simple, of course. At first the idea was to do something short yet functional, but in the middle of the process I decided to add new things here and there, like displaying some weather info, some animations, a menu for each item etc.<br><br>
The cost of not having a definitive vision of what I wanted it to be is a <strong>messy code</strong>. A lot of refactoring needs to be done in the JS file to make it more understandable. But, again, IT - WORKS :grinning: and so far I seem to have fixed all the possible bugs.<br><br>

<h3>01. The app displays some info in it's header, such as weather info with a background picture (if user allow it), current day and hour.</h3><br><br>
